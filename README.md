UltimateHotbars replaces Minecraft’s vanilla hotbar system: **100 pages** of **10 hotbars** each (1,000 total), fully synced between client and server.

## What It Does

* Overrides hotbar interactions so both client and server use your virtual hotbar.
* Maps vanilla hotbar controls to your virtual slots.

## Features

* **1,000 Slots**: 100 pages × 10 slots.
* **Hotbar Navigation**: custom keybinds for slots/pages.
* **HUD Overlay**: Shows current page and slot highlight.

## Usage

### In-World (no GUI open)

* **Decrease Hotbar**: Press the "Decrease Hotbar" key (default "-" configured in Controls) to move one slot backward.
* **Increase Hotbar**: Press the "Increase Hotbar" (default "=" configured in Controls) key to move one slot forward.
* **Decrease Page**: Press the "Decrease Page" (default "CTRL and -" configured in Controls) key to go to the previous page.
* **Increase Page**: Press the "Increase Page" (default "CTRL and =" configured in Controls) key to go to the next page.
* **Open GUI**: Press the "Open GUI" key (default "H" configured in Controls) to open the full Hotbar GUI.

### In Container GUIs (Inventory, Chest, JEI, etc.)

* **Left / Right Arrows**: Switch to the next or previous hotbar.
* **Up / Down Arrows**: Switch to the next or previous page.

### Hotbar GUI

1. After opening (via "H" by default), you’ll see a grid of pages and slots.
2. Click to select a hotbar.
3. Use arrow keys to move between pages / hotbars.

## Configuration

* Customize keybindings in Minecraft’s Controls menu.
