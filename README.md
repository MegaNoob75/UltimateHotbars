**UltimateHotbars** is a Minecraft Forge mod (1.20.1 / Forge) that gives you virtually unlimited custom hotbars and pages. Easily switch between them in-game or in any inventory screen, save and restore layouts, and keep your tools, and resources organized!

This is the new Version 2 of the mod. Version 1 will no longer be worked on or updated so please switch to the V2 branch/version.
In the config menu hit the Purge Data Files button if your comming from V1.x.x as the hot bar data files are not compatable and it will be all messed up. 
(Sorry you will have to start fresh with your Hot bars.)
